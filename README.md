# Recycling-Educational-Game

This is an educational game about recycling in Utah. This was made a few semesters ago with a team of 4 other students. It has been updated to include some new features.


# Overview of the Game Functionality 

The recycling game ia a drag and drop game with multiple levels. At each level the player is given a top bar of trash, or recycling items.
They must drag the items into the correct bins in accordance with the Salt Lake City recycling rules. Users are notified if they make a wrong decision and are asked to try again. 
Once all items have been moved to a bin users will be automatically taken to the next level via the loading page. Check out the video to see how gameplay works!

### Improvements Paragraph

The game flow could be improved. The look of the second page with instructions is in the works. Minor bugs with dragging and dropping off screen have been fixed.

# Acknowledgements:

This was originally made for a class at the University of Utah but I think it is a good example of my work, in both designing the main page and helping wiht the underlying logic of drag and drop etc...
All of this code was written by myself or members of my team and not provided by the university of utah.
